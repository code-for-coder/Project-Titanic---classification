Project Title
Titanic Classification: Predicting Survival with Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about passengers such as age, class, gender, and embarkation details. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and classification models, we analyze the data and build predictive models.
